# BabyMon
**BabyMon** is a motion-sensing, temperature-detecting, night-vision-capable video surveillance.

## Hardware Requirements
In order for this project to run properly, you must have the following hardware:
1. Raspberry Pi (I'm using model 3B)
2. Raspberry Pi Camera Module
3. USB Microphone
4. Temperature monitor

## Setup
1. Make sure your client computer and raspberry pi are on the same network.
2. In command line, run `python3 server.py` and visit `raspberrypi:8000` in your browser!
* Note - "raspberrypi" should be your raspberry pi's IP address - such as 192.168.1.24
